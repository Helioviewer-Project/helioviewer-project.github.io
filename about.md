### The Helioviewer Project

The aim of the Helioviewer Project is to enable exploration of the Sun and the inner heliosphere for everyone, everywhere via intuitive interfaces and novel technology.  
The project is split into two main development efforts:  
**[Helioviewer.org](https://helioviewer.org)** - A web application for visualizing solar images and feature/event data in the web browser.  
**[JHelioviewer](https://www.jhelioviewer.org)** - A Java/OpenGL application for visualizing time series of solar images and feature/event data.
