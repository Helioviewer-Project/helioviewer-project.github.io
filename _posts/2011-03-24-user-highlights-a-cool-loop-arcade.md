The [event below](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YCDj_a7u7w&feature=youtube_gdata_player) was found and shared by helioviewer.org and [YouTube user &#8220;LudzikLegoTechnics&#8221;](http://www.youtube.com/user/LudzikLegoTechnics) &#8211; thanks for that! It&#8217;s a wonderful example of a cool loop arcade forming and evolving.

  <strong> </strong><strong></strong>Cool loop arcade seen in SDO AIA 304.

What you&#8217;re looking at is a bunch of magnetic field lines, forming into loops of relatively cool plasma (50,000 K), at the limb of the Sun. For comparison, the surface of the Sun is around 4500-6000 K, and natural temperatures on the Earth&#8217;s surface are around 200 &#8211; 340 K.

There are quite a number of things going on here. Firstly, there are [two active regions quite close by each other](http://www.solarmonitor.org/full_disk.php?date=20110316&type=saia_00193&indexnum=1). Secondly, in the movie below (in AIA 171, which sees plasma at around 600,000 K):

you can see that some field lines appear to open up and a small faint eruption takes off. Finally, the loops form, with bright loop tops; it is likely that [magnetic reconnection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_reconnection) is taking place here. All in all, this is a very good example of just how complicated the activity on the Sun can be; with so much going on, there&#8217;s a lot to learn.
