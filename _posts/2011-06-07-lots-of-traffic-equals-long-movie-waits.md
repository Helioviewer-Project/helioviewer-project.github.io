As you may have already noticed if you tried to make a movie this afternoon, the estimated wait time for new movies requests is currently very long due to the [exciting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkW_yByO7r4) [eruption](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xESw6G8JdM) we saw this morning. Usually when you request a movie it will be created within a couple minutes. Right now, however, the queue time is in the hours range.

All movie requests will be handled in the order they areÂ received, so you are welcome to queue up a video and check back later in the day to see if the video is available. Another option though would be to check out [some](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJN0hWMrugE&feature=youtube_gdata_player) of the [excellent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONCptM65fu0&feature=youtube_gdata_player) [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJN0hWMrugE&feature=youtube_gdata_player) made by other Helioviewer.org users. You can use the arrow buttons or mouse-wheel to scroll down the list of shared videos on bottom-right of the page and see what other people have made.
