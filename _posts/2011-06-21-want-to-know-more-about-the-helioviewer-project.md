Dan Pendick recently posted an excellent series of articles about [the Helioviewer Project](http://wiki.helioviewer.org/wiki/Background_to_the_Helioviewer_Project) on his blog, [Geeked on Goddard](http://geeked.gsfc.nasa.gov/). In five short articles Dan describes many of the different parts of the project, including [Helioviewer.org](http://helioviewer.org) and [JHelioviewer](http://jhelioviewer.org). He also discusses some of the technologies that have made all of this possible. If you are interested in learning more about the project and how it all works, you should definitely check out the articles. Also, if you are a science/tech enthusiast I would highly recommend subscribing to [Dan&#8217;s blog](http://geeked.gsfc.nasa.gov/) where you can learn more about some of the other cool projects that call the [NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html) their home.
