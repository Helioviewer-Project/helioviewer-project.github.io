[helioviewer.org](https://www.helioviewer.org) is now much easier to use on mobile devices. You can view the latest images of the Sun and inner heliosphere, overlay features and events, and make screenshots and movies, just as you can using [helioviewer.org](https://www.helioviewer.org) on a laptop or desktop.
