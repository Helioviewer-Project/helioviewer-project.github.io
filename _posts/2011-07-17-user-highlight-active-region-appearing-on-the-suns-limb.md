YouTube and helioviewer.org user [galaxy387](http://www.youtube.com/user/galaxy387) shared [this movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edp9PZkpqv4) of an active region appearing on the limb of the Sun.



It&#8217;s a great example of the complex evolution that an active can undergo in a relatively short amount of time. [Studying the evolution of active region loops](http://www.uibcongres.org/congresos/ficha.en.html?cc=205) on the limb cuts right through the loops themselves so you don&#8217;t see any of the disk emission along your line of sight, and so removes a potential source of confusion.
