We&#8217;re working on including data from NASA&#8217;s STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory, [stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov)) mission. It&#8217;s a mission consisting of two spacecraft, one drifting ahead of the Earth, and drifting behind, taking images of the Sun and the inner heliosphere. The concept behind the mission is to view the Sun as a three-dimensional object, from which we can better understand its surface structures and how it influences the inner heliosphere. This is [the view from STEREO-A](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP_P2bxuUD8), and this is [the view of the same event from STEREO-B](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVSkVm2dXlc). Both movies are of coronagraph data taken with the COR2 instrument; both STEREO spacecraft have the same instrument suites onboard.

We hope to have a stream of the very latest STEREO images very soon. Watch this space!
