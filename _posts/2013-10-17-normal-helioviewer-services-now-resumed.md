Full Helioviewer Project services originating at NASA &#8211; helioviewer.org, JHelioviewer and the Helioviewer API &#8211; are now back up and running. Over the next couple of days we will be backfilling in missing data from the period October 1 &#8211; 17, 2013. Thanks to our colleagues at the [Space Influences Data Center (SIDC)](http://sidc.be/) at the [Royal Observatory of Belgium](http://www.observatory.be/) for providing Helioviewer services in that period.

JHelioviewer users who edited their user profile files to use the ROB server can switch back to using Helioviewer services at NASA by removing the edits

We thank you for your patience over the past couple of weeks.
