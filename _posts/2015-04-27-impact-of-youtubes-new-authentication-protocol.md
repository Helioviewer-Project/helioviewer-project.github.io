In the past week, YouTube changed their authentication protocol. The authentication protocol is used by helioviewer.org to allow users to upload movies directly from helioviewer.org to a user&#8217;s YouTube account. We are currently working on changing helioviewer.org to take account of the change in Youtube&#8217;s authorization protocol. Currently, it is not possible to upload movies directly from helioviewer.org to YouTube.

However, it is still possible to upload movies made by helioviewer.org. If you download the movie to your computer, log in to your YouTube account, and use that to upload and publish your helioviewer.org movie.

We apologize for the interruption in helioviewer.org&#8217;s ability to upload movies directly to YouTube. We are working on updating helioviewer.org to accommodate the new YouTube protocol.
