Although Tuesday&#8217;s eruption was certainly a wonderful sight, it isn&#8217;t the first time that SOHO and SDO were able to capture some really cool events in action.

Here are some videos of other events that from earlier this year, starting with a few of the videos from this week&#8217;s eruption:
