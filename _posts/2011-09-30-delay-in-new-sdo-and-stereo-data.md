You may have noticed a delay in the availability of new [SDO](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov) images. We are currently troubleshooting the issue with the pipeline we use to obtain near real time images of the Sun. We are also currently developing an alternate capability that will provide you with at least some images at a lower cadence and a lower spatial resolution.

Our pipeline that provides the most recent high quality [STEREO](http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov) data is also temporarily unavailable. We took that offline to diagnose issues in the pipeline that are causing it to crash unexpectedly. Also, we are fixing an image processing issue whereby some COR2 images appeared as a solid white annular region.

We apologize for the interruption to our services, and for any inconvenience this may cause. We are working hard to get these images to you.
