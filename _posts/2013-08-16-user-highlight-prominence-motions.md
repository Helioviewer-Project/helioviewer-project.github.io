[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) and Helioviewer.org user [CuriousTess](http://www.youtube.com/user/CuriousTess?feature=watch) shared two two colour movie of a prominence coming over the solar limb. The first one shows the prominence at the solar limb:



and the second one shows the same feature further onto disk:



These movies show motions in a solar prominence. Prominences are clouds of relatively cool plasma magnetically suspended in the hotter surrounding solar atmosphere. By studying the motions and oscillations in a prominence, we can gain insight into their dynamic structure. A longer term research goal is to understand what makes some prominences unstable and erupt into space, while others don&#8217;t.

This image in the AIA 304 channel shows the same prominence:

You can see from this picture that the prominence extends for a considerable distance, and appears to bend.

Thanks for sharing these movies, [CuriousTess](http://www.youtube.com/user/CuriousTess?feature=watch)!
