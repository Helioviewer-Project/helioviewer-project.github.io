The movie below shows the PROBA2-SWAP view of the transit so far:



Venus appears to swing north and south in this movie &#8211; [this was predicted](http://proba2.nicula.net/venus_transit_2012_predict.mov) by the operators of SWAP at the [Royal Observatory of Belgium](http://www.astro.oma.be/) [Solar Data Influences Center](http://www.sidc.be/). It is caused by the [orbit](http://proba2.oma.be/index.html/about/article/launch-and-orbit) of the PROBA2 spacecraft around the Earth creating very different points of view of at different times in the orbit.

More movies to come!
