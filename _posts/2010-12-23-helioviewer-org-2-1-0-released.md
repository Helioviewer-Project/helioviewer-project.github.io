**RELEASE NOTES:**

[Helioviewer.org 2.1.0](https://launchpad.net/helioviewer.org/2.0/2.1.0) is a major release which includes many new features and a large number of bug fixes. Major features added include: full support for AIA images, on the fly movie and screenshot creation and a custom resource management and queuing system. Other changes include:

_**New features**:_

* Overhauled error back-end error handling  
* Support for HEK FRM/Event querying  
* PHP IMagick used in place of convert when available for better performance (See: http://valokuva.org/?p=40 for more information)  
* Custom FFmpeg wrapper used in place of PHPVideoToolkit  
* FirePHP support  
* Documentation for each back-end module now handled at the module level rather than globally  
* IE8 local storage support  
* Conversion from tile coordinates to spatial coordinates now handled on front-end  
* Removed dependencies on image archive directory structure  
* Added a JHelioviewer JNLP generation method so that users can easily jump from Helioviewer.org to JHelioviewer  
* Color of image layer timestamps now ranges on a scale from green (near requested time) to red (far from requested time). Absolute difference is used so that it does not matter whether actual image is ahead or behind requested one
