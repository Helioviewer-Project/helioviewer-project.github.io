All Helioviewer services (helioviewer.org, JHelioviewer and any use of the API) will cease temporarily in the next few hours. Users of helioviewer.org will be re-directed to [notice.usa.gov](http://notice.usa.gov). Users of JHelioviewer will not be able to stream movies from the main Helioviewer server. Users of the API will not receive any data from their requests.

Helioviewer services are ceasing temporarily due to a partial shutdown of the US federal government. 

We apologize for the interruption to our service. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible. Please keep checking this blog for further updates.
