Some of you may have noticed that we have not had any new AIA or HMI images in the past few hours. AIA and HMI are still taking data, and that data is still being beamed down to the Earth, where it is being stored and distributed around the world. The problem lies in the pipeline we use to convert that AIA and HMI science data into images that are used by the Helioviewer Project. The Helioviewer Project team is currently working to find and fix the problem. Images from other instruments, such as EIT and LASCO C2 are unaffected.

We&#8217;ll post a blog entry as soon as AIA and HMI images become available again, and images that are currently missing will be filled in.

Sorry for the interruption, but we&#8217;ll be back with the latest solar images for you to explore, as soon as we can.
