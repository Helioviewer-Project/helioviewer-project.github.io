ESA Summer of Code in Space 2012 (SOCIS) is a program run by the European Space Agency. It offers student developers stipends to write code for various space-related open source software projects. Through SOCIS, students will be paired with mentors from participating project teams, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development. The program is inspired by (but not affiliated or related in any way to) Google&#8217;s Summer of Code initiative.

[JHelioviewer](http://www.jhelioviewer.org), in collaboration with [the start-up company Luxunda](http://www.luxunda.es/), and [SunPy](http://www.sunpy.org/) have been selected as mentoring organizations, and students are encouraged to [apply until 27 July 2012 (11 am UTC)](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2012/?q=node/11).
