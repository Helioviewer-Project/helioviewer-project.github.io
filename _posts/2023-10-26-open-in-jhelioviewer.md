Helioviewer now supports opening helioviewer.org movies in [JHelioviewer](https://www.jhelioviewer.org/).

To open a movie in JHelioviewer, first have JHelioviewer running, then open one of your movies in [helioviewer.org](https://helioviewer.org).

In the bottom right of the video player window you will see an "Open In JHelioviewer" button.

If JHelioviewer is not running, the button will say "JHV is not open" and the button will not be clickable. Make sure to open JHelioviewer first.

When you click the button, JHelioviewer will display a notification asking if you'd like to accept the incoming request.
