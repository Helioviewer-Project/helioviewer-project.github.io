Helioviewer and [YouTube user otraLoly](http://www.youtube.com/user/otraLoly) spotted this interesting active region earlier on today.



Right at the very start you can see that loops on the southern side of the active region appear to contract (a CME and a prominence eruption are occuring). As the event progresses, you&#8217;ll notice that two dark areas appear in the [coronal](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap991227.html) [moss](http://www.solarviews.com/eng/tracepr2.htm), outlined by some very bright, and small scale emission, which end up as loop footpoints to the subsequent loop brightening that occurs. This event is interesting for the detail it is possible to see in AIA, particularly in the brightening of the loop footpoints before the main bright loop occurs. Thanks to user [otraLoly](http://www.youtube.com/user/otraLoly) for sharing this video with users of [helioviewer.org](http://www.helioviewer.org)!
