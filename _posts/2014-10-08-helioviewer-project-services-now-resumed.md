We are pleased to report that all Helioviewer Project services should now be operational. Helioviewer.org and JHelioviewer services should now be operating normally. Over the next couple of days we will fill in any gaps in data coverage. Note that users of JHelioviewer who edited their _users.properties_ to user services provided by the [Institut d&#8217;Astrophysique Spatiale](http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/) can either continue using their service, or remove their edits.

We apologize for the interruption to Helioviewer Project services.
