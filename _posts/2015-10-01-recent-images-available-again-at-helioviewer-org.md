We are pleased to announce that recent images are once again available at helioviewer.org. Data gaps from throughout the year are being filled in.

Two features are as yet unavailable &#8211; direct Helioviewer to YouTube uploading, and Bitly URL shortening functionality. All other functions should work as before. Users can make and download movies and post them to YouTube. We are working to get these features back as soon as possible.

Our thanks also go to our colleagues at the [Institut dâ€™Astrophysique Spatiale](http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/) for their support and services whilst helioviewer.org was undergoing maintenance.
