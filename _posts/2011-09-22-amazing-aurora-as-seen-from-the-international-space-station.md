This amazing video of the aurora was taken from the International Space Station:



Aurora are [caused](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_%28astronomy%29) by the interaction of solar-sourced particles with the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and atmosphere. During times of geomagnetic storms (as has happened [recently](http://www.space.com/12929-northern-lights-photos-skywatchers-september.html)) the aurora get pushed towards the equator, leading to many more people being able to see them.

This video, and many others taken from the International Space Station can be found [here](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html?collection_id=74731).
