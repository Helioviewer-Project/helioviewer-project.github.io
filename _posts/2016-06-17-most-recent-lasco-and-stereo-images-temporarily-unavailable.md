The computer that converts most recently acquired LASCO and STEREO observations to images served via the Helioviewer Project suffered a hardware failure on June 6 2016.  This means that LASCO and STEREO images from June 6 2016 onwards are currently not available via the Helioviewer Project clients such as helioviewer.org and JHelioviewer.   We apologize for the temporary unavailability of these images and any inconvenience it may cause.  We hope to have the pipeline that supplies the most recent images up and running again in the next couple of weeks.  Images before June 6 2016 are available as normal.

In the mean time, users can find near real time LASCO images at the [SOHO homepage](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov) and the most recent STEREO images at the [STEREO mission page](http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov).
