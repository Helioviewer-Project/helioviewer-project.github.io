Helioviewer Project services (helioviewer.org, api.helioviewer.org and JHelioviewer connections at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center) will be suspended temporarily later today (6 March 2017) for necessary maintenance.  The outage is anticipated to start around 4pm Eastern Standard Time.  We anticipate that services will be suspended for about 24 hours.  Normal service will resume as soon as possible.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
