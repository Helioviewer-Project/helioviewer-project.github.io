As some of you may have noticed, a few new features were added to Helioviewer.org last week, following the release of [a new version of the web-site](https://launchpad.net/helioviewer.org/2.2/2.2.1).

Probably the most useful change included in this release is the ability to share movie links in Helioviewer.org without having to upload a movie to YouTube first.
