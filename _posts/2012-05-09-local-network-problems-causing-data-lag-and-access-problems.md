We are currently experiencing some issues with our local network. Users of helioviewer.org may experience some difficulties in reaching the site, and users of JHelioviewer may experience difficulties in streaming data. The network problems are also making it difficult for us to acquire the most recent images; hence, SDO AIA and HMI images are currently lagging well behind near real-time.

Our network engineers are aware of these problems, and are working on them. We apologize for the interruptions to our services. We will be back to normal operations as soon as possible.

Helioviewer Team.
