Sometimes, instruments that are not specifically designed to observe the Sun can see something from the Sun. This was the case with [Fermi](http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/), a [gamma ray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray) telescope operated by NASA. Its primary mission is to study the most energetic features and events in the Universe, such as supermassive black holes and the merging of neutron stars. Sometimes, however, the Sun makes an appearance in Fermi data. The following GOES X-class flare on March 7th, 2012

was an intense source of gamma-rays. SDO-AIA is not designed to observe gamma-rays. However, Fermi saw the gamma rays from this event. For a great explanation of what Fermi saw from the Sun, check out the following video.
