The Helioviewer Project is pleased to announce that a new generation of JHelioviewer is available for download from <a href="http://jhelioviewer.org" target="_blank">http://jhelioviewer.org</a> and <a href="http://sidc.be/jhelioviewer" target="_blank">http://sidc.be/jhelioviewer</a>.

JHelioviewer is an open-source application for visualization of solar images based on the JPEG 2000 standard. It is part of the ESA/NASA Helioviewer Project and another client to the Helioviewer web services alongside the <a href="http://helioviewer.org" target="_blank">Helioviewer.org</a> web application. Since 2013, the whole software stack was revisited under ESA Contract No. 4000107325/12/NL/AK, commonly referred to as “Space Weather HelioViewer”. Many of the new additions will be of particular interest to the Space Weather community.

The new JHelioviewer &#8220;2.10&#8221; is significantly faster and more robust while offering a large number of new features, e.g.:

  * Access to new datasets (GONG, SOLIS, etc.) from 3 different servers (GSFC, ROB, IAS)
  * Combined view from different vantage points (e.g. <a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">STEREO</a> and <a href="http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">SDO</a>) for full sphere mapping
  * Image projections such as orthographic, latitudinal and polar
  * Yet more viewing options, such as running and base differences, and a side-by-side (multi-view) mode
  * Timeline datasets viewing, synchronized with the time of the current image
  * Integration of features and events from the <a href="https://www.lmsal.com/hek/" target="_blank">Heliophysics Events Knowledgebase (HEK)</a>, and alerts from the COMESEP system.
  * Magnetic field line extrapolations

A full description of the installation, running of the software and new features can be found in the <a href="http://sidc.be/jhelioviewer/" target="_blank">online user manual</a>.

The work was carried out by SIDC @ Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB). The new JHelioviewer will continue to undergo improvements in the future, meanwhile feedback is welcome at swhv – at &#8211; sidc.be .
