[Helioviewer.org](http://www.helioviewer.org) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) user [danielchangck](http://www.youtube.com/user/danielchangck) found this event:



What happened? Well, there was an eruption on the back side of the Sun, that caused a propagating disturbance in the solar atmosphere. that appears to have triggered a prominence lift-off on the front-side of the Sun. This is a great example of how the high cadence, continuous observations from [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov) give us a much better view of how distant parts of the Sun can physically influence each other. We liked this event so much we made and uploaded some movies of our own. The lower cadence of these movies allows you to see the swaying of coronal material in response to the disturbance from the initial eruption.
