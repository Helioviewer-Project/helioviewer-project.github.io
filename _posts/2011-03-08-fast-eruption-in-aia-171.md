After many large and interesting events yesterday, the Sun produced this spectacular eruptive event late yesterday.

  <strong> </strong><strong></strong>Fast eruption in SDO AIA 171.

This lead to a coronal mass ejection with a speed of around 2200 km/s, one of the fastest we&#8217;ve seen in the current solar cycle. Interestingly, this erupted material had a lot of bright emission in the AIA 171 pass band, indicating bright or dense (or both) material at around 1,000,000 K, which whilst not unusual, isn&#8217;t too common either. The bright loops remaining at the surface of the Sun are known as post-flare loops.
