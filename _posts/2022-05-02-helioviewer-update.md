The helioviewer migration to the new server is nearly complete. The
[Helioviewer Website](https://helioviewer.org) is up and running.

We are still working on setting up the data pipeline for SOHO and
STEREO so these image sources will not be updated for some
time. Another update will follow when these image sources are
updated. This impacts both GSFC and GSFC Beta

We are still working on bringing up the JPIP server, which should be
up shortly. In the meantime GSFC Beta is still available.
