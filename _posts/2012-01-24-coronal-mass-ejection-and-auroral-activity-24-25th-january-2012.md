The coronal mass ejection associated with the flare event of 23 January 2012 [has just been spotted](http://www.facebook.com/pages/NOAA-NWS-Space-Weather-Prediction-Center/232532740131296) by the [Advanced Composition Explorer](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/) (ACE) spacecraft. [ACE](http://science.nasa.gov/missions/ace/) orbits the [L1 libration point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point) which is a point of Earth-Sun gravitational equilibrium about 1.5 million km from Earth and 148.5 million km from the Sun. From its location at [L1](http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/gloss_kl.html) ACE has a prime view of the solar wind, interplanetary magnetic field and higher energy particles accelerated by the Sun, as well as particles accelerated in the heliosphere and the galactic regions beyond. 

You can [check here for recent observations of the distribution of the aurora borealis from space](http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/), courtesy of the [NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov) [Polar Operational Environmental Satellite](http://www.oso.noaa.gov/poes/index.htm). NOAA also have a test data product and webpage that shows the output of a model that [predicts the probability of seeing the aurora](http://helios.swpc.noaa.gov/ovation/). You can keep informed on the latest space weather activity at [NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center](http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) and the [Integrated Space Weather Laboratory](http://iswa.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov:8080/IswaSystemWebApp/).

Here are some more movies of the original event shared by our users &#8211; thanks to everyone!

YouTube and Helioviewer.org user [losyziemi](http://www.youtube.com/user/losyziemi) shared this video of the eruption and the consequent view in LASCO C2 and C3. Those streaks and dots are due to particles accelerated by the event impacting the detectors of LASCO C2 and C3  


YouTube and Helioviewer.org user [otraLoly](http://www.youtube.com/user/otraLoly) shared this video of the eruption, concentrating on AIA 171 and LASCO C2.
