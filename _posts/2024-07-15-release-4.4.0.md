## New Data Sources

| Data Source       | Provider |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| RHESSI (Image Layer)           | [NASA GSFC](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/) |
| RHESSI Flare List (Features & Events) | [NASA GSFC](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/) |

## New Features

### RHESSI
The [Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/rhessi/) (RHESSI) was
launched on February 2nd, 2002 and took data until July 20th, 2018. It
observed the whole Sun in high energy X-rays. These are commonly
produced during solar flares and their analysis provides information on
particle acceleration on the Sun at solar flare sites. The images displayed
by Helioviewer show the emission in different energy bands denoted in
kilo-electron volts (keV). Users can also select images based on different
[image reconstruction methods](https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/software/imaging-software/image-algorithm-summary/index.html).
The images here are the same as those held by the [RHESSI Flare Image Archive](https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/rhessi/rhessi_extras/flare_images_v2/hsi_flare_image_archive.html).
We would like to thank the RHESSI team for their help in making RHESSI
flare images and data available via Helioviewer.

When viewing RHESSI data, the RHESSI section under Features and Events can
be used to get more information about the observed flare.

Selecting the flare pin will reveal the flare's event information.

Selecting Full analysis will take you to that flare's analysis page
within the [RHESSI Image Archive](https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/rhessi/rhessi_extras/flare_images_v2/hsi_flare_image_archive.html).

### New Permanent Sharing URLs

Viewport sharing has been available in Helioviewer for some time, however
previous short links were temporary. The new sharing links are permanent
links to the current viewport. These links will load Helioviewer with the same
observation time, images, and event selections that were present when the link was created.

### Image Date Warning

When the observation date and the timestamp of the nearest image available
for that observation date are more than 12 hours apart, a warning will appear.
Helioviewer always shows the nearest available image, even if that image happens
to be years away, which can cause some confusion when overlaying multiple data
sources.

Previously, the only indicator for this is the image date turning red in the
sidebar. Now it also comes with a warning that you may use to update the
observation time, if desired.

### Individual Event Selection

Individual events can now be shown or hidden, instead of only being able to
control groups of events. This also applies to any screenshots and movies
that you make.

### Jump to next image

Navigating a specific set of images is now easier by using new buttons which
update the observation time to the timestamp of the next (or previous) image in the selected
data source.
Using the <img style="vertical-align: middle; padding-bottom: 3px; display: inline;" alt="forward and back" src="/images/uploads/2024/fwd_back.png" /> buttons, you can update the image to the next image for
that data source.
