We're pleased to announce the addition of a new 3D mode to Helioviewer.org.
This new visualization capability expands how users can observe and study the
Sun and heliosphere directly through their web browsers.

## 3D Visualization Capabilities
The new 3D mode allows users to view solar imagery in a three-dimensional space,
fully taking into account the location of the instrument in space when the data was
taken. We can now correctly overlay image data from spacecraft such as STEREO and
Solar Orbiter. This implementation builds on testing and comparison with the established
JHelioviewer application's 3D capabilities.

## Current Functionality
In this initial release of 3D mode, users can:
- View solar imagery in a 3D environment
- Adjust viewing angles to observe solar features from different perspectives
- Examine spatial relationships of solar phenomena

The current 3D implementation has some limitations compared to the standard 2D
view. The following features are not available in the 3D viewport at this time:

- Display of features & events
- Screenshot functionality
- Movie creation

These functions continue to work in the standard 2D mode as development
continues on the 3D environment.

## Accessing 3D Mode

Users will find a "3D View" option in the Helioviewer.org interface.
Selecting this option switches from the standard 2D view to the 3D environment.
Users can toggle between modes as needed.

## Development Roadmap

Work continues on expanding the capabilities of the 3D mode, with future updates
planned to incorporate the additional functionality currently only
available in 2D mode.

## Feedback

User feedback on this new feature will help guide future development.
We welcome observations and suggestions as users explore the new capabilities.
