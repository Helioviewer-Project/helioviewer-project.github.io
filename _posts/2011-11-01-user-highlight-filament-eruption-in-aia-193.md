[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) and [Helioviewer.org](http://www.helioviewer.org) user [muriealdurian](http://www.youtube.com/user/muriealdurian) just uploaded [this video](http://helioviewer.org/?movieId=dCs15) of a [filament eruption as seen in AIA 193](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuNjzjOwH0M):



The [filament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence)(1) is the narrow dark moving thread in the middle of the field of view. As the movie progresses the filament evolves and eventually erupts out in to space, causing a [coronal mass ejection](http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme.html). The material underneath the filament darkens, indicating an evacuation of plasma, that is, the plasma is draining away from that part of the solar atmosphere. These kinds of events happen a lot, and will happen more as solar activity ramps up. Thank you, [muriealdurian](http://www.youtube.com/user/muriealdurian), for uploading a good example of a filament eruption.

(1) Prominences are filaments seen over the limb of the Sun &#8211; prominences and filaments are the same thing, but have different names for historical reasons. Prominences and filaments were first observed in different wavelengths, and so acquired different names. Later, we realized that they were the same thing, but the two names have stuck around in the literature.
