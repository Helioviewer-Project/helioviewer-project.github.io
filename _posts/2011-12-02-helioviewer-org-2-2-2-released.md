**RELEASE NOTES:**

[Helioviewer.org 2.2.2](https://launchpad.net/helioviewer.org/2.2/2.2.2) is an incremental release. This release is focused on sharing. Buttons have been added below movies to make it easier to share the movie on Facebook, Twitter, etc and optional link-shortening has been included for both Helioviewer.org and movie URLs using bit.ly. Another new feature is a visual glossary. While still a work in progress, the glossary aims to help make it easier to find out what the different terms used on Helioviewer.org, and also help determine what a partcular feature or event is.
