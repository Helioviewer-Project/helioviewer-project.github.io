Helioviewer user [otraLoly](http://www.youtube.com/user/otraLoly) was first to share this rather spectacular looking event in SDO AIA data yesterday:



As the event progresses, you can clearly see that the material is spiraling around as it slowly moves away from the Sun&#8217;s surface. It may be associated with an ejection seen in LASCO C2, although the data here is as yet incomplete. Other users have also shred movies of the same event: here is one shared by [danielchangck](http://www.youtube.com/user/danielchangck):



and another movie shared by [papavalium](http://www.youtube.com/user/papavalium):



If you find something interesting, please let us know by either emailing us at contact@helioviewer.org, or by sharing it on helioviewer.org via YouTube.

Thanks!
