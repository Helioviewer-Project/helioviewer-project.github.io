We apologize for the lack of new images from AIA. This is due to issues outwith our control. We create the images you see from [AIA level 1.5](http://jsoc.stanford.edu/data/jsoc_proc_status.html) data products (the number refers to the degree of image calibration, etc., that has been applied to the raw data) that are processed at [SDO Joint Science Operations Center](http://jsoc.stanford.edu). [As you can see](http://jsoc.stanford.edu/data/jsoc_proc_status.html), those data appear to be lagging at the moment. As soon as the data returns, Helioviewer will automatically generate images and make them available.
