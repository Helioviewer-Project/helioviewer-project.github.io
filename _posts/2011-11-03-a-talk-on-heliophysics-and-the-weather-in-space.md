NASA astrophysicist James Klimchuk recently gave a talk to the [American Geophysical Union](www.agu.org) on the connection between the Sun, space weather and the Earth.



Dr. Klimchuk gives a great description of the chain of physics that leads from the Sun to the Earth, and it is well worth a look for those who want to get an overview of how events on the Sun can affect the Earth. For example [at this time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=yOag-1yQQxM#t=1278s) Dr. Klimchuk talks about the solar prominences and how we create artificial eclipses to see coronal mass ejections. [From here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=yOag-1yQQxM#t=1593s) Dr. Klimchuk talks about the production of the [aurora](https://blog.helioviewer.org/2011/09/22/amazing-aurora-as-seen-from-the-international-space-station/) and other effects that Earth-directed coronal mass ejections can produce.
