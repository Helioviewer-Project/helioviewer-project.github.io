Thanks to NASA&#8217;s [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) mission, the Helioviewer server, hosted in the [Solar Data Analysis Center](http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/) at the [Goddard Space Flight Center](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html), Maryland, USA, has acquired and made operational an additional 15TB of storage. This will allow us to maintain through the coming year, the same level of service of [Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)](http://aia.lmsal.com/) and other images that we already provide through the [Helioviewer.org](http://helioviewer.org) and [JHelioviewer](http://jhelioviewer.org) browse clients. This new storage will allow us to keep _all_ the images we already have, plus new images from the upcoming year, online and available for our users to browse as they please. As always, we welcome any comments on how we may improve our service, and we look forward to what the Sun will bring us in 2011!
