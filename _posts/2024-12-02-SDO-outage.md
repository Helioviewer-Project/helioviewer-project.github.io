A cooling water line burst in the Stanford building housing the SDO data pipeline
servers on 2024-11-26. Currently, SDO data servers are offline while the damage is
assessed and repaired. This means that all HMI and AIA data from SDO will be unavailable
until repairs are completed and the pipeline is restarted, and thus no data from SDO
past 2024-11-26 will show on this webpage. We appreciate your understanding, and are
grateful for the dedication and responsiveness of the Stanford team.
