Helioviewer.org and JHelioviewer are both back online after last week&#8217;s outage.

The downtime was caused by a problem encountered while expanding our storage capacity, which has since been fixed.

We are currently in the process of restoring images from some earlier years and as a result certain images may not be accessible over the next couple days.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
