The Helioviewer Project is pleased to announce that Helioviewer.org 3.1 is now available. This [new version of helioviewer.org](http://wiki.helioviewer.org/wiki/Helioviewer.org_User_Guide_3.1.0) adds two new features, an **event timeline** and **improved YouTube movie browsing**.

The **event timeline** allows you to pan backwards and forwards in time, and zoom in and out, browsing what happened and when it happened on the Sun.  It is accessible via a tab at the bottom of the viewer window, and works in the same way as the image timeline.

The **YouTube movie browser** now allows you to see if any shared movies include the date and time you are looking at.  It&#8217;s a way of finding out what other people have seen on the Sun.
