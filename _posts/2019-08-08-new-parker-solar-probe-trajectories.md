[Parker Solar Probe](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/) was [launched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUClxcUbuNM) on 12th August, 2018. It will swoop to within 4 million miles of the sun&#8217;s surface, facing heat and radiation like no spacecraft before it. Parker Solar Probe will provide new data on solar activity and make critical contributions to our ability to forecast major space-weather events that impact life on Earth.

Parker Solar Probe makes multiple close encounters with the Sun.  The primary science observations happen around the close encounters, and last about 10 days.  [Helioviewer.org](https://helioviewer.org) now provides the trajectory of Parker Solar Probe as seen from [SOHO](https://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/) and [STEREO-A](https://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) for the primary science observation phase.

Open up the data sources &#8211; there is a new option &#8220;Celestial bodies&#8221;.

Choose SOHO if you are looking at AIA and LASCO data; otherwise select STEREO-A.  You can use the &#8220;Last&#8221; and &#8220;Next&#8221; buttons to jump forward and back to the previous and next Parker Solar Probe encounters. Click on the check boxes to show the encounter trajectories and Parker Solar Probe position.

Screen shots and [movies also show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eLgf1hmkeM) whatever is selected:
