Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) images are now
available via [helioviewer.org](https://www.helioviewer.org).

[Solar Orbiter](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter)
was launched on February
9th, 2020. [It is designed](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-orbiter) to
take in-situ measurements of the inner heliosphere and nascent solar
wind, and perform observations of the Sun's polar regions. Solar
Orbiter orbits the Sun (not the Earth) and its orbital inclination and
distance from the Sun will change substantially during the mission
lifetime to get ever better views of the Sun's polar regions. Most
observations will be from off the Sun-Earth line (note that most
STEREO observations have been taken from well away from the Sun-Earth
line). Additionally, given the mission profile, data download rates
and latencies can vary, and so images close to real time are nominally
not available.

[EUI]( https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201936663) observes the Sun
in extreme ultraviolet light, and consists of two High Resolution
Imagers (HRIs) and one Full Sun Imager (FSI). The HRIs take high
resolution images of portions of the solar atmosphere - they do not
view the entire disk of the Sun. The FSI views the full disk of the
Sun, and also images a wider field of view compared to AIA, and so can
image the extended solar corona.

Data from EUI are processed into images for use with helioviewer.org
and [JHelioviewer](https://jhelioviewer.org) by the
[Helioviewer Project](https://github.com/helioviewer-project) partner
institute the
[Royal Observatory of Belgium](https://www.astro.oma.be/en/scientific-research/solar-physics-space-weather/). We
hope you enjoy examining EUI images.
