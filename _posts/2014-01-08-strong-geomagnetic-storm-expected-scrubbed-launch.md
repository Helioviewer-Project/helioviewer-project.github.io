Yesterday, many users posted movies of the first X-class flare of 2014:

As a result of this flare and the accompanying coronal mass ejection, the  
[Space Weather Prediction Center](http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([](http://www.noaa.gov/)NOAA) are anticipating strong Geomagnetic Storm conditions to occur on January 9 and 10.

The high level of radiation due to this eruptive event also led to the scrubbing of a [resupply mission to the International Space Station](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/launch/orbital.html#.Us2Rx_RDs3u) (ISS).

Thanks again to our users for sharing their movies!
