The transition to using the HTTPS protocol broke Helioviewer&#8217;s YouTube sharing capability. We tracked down the source of the bug and have fixed it. YouTube sharing has now been re-enabled.Â  Please let us know if you continue to encounter any problems sharing videos from Helioviewer.org to YouTube.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for using the Helioviewer Project.
