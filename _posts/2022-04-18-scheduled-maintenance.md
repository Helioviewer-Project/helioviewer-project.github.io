Helioviewer will be down on May 2nd between 13:00:00 UTC to 21:00:00
UTC

We will be migrating helioviewer to a new server with more available
storage space. This will resolve the problems we have been having
lately with images not loading, and image sources lagging behind what
should be available.

Another announcement will be made on May 2nd when the migration is
complete.
