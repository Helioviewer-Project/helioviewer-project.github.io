[helioviewer.org](https://helioviewer.org) will be undergoing scheduled maintenance for infrastructure transfer over the next week.

During this maintenance period you can expect the following:
- helioviewer.org may be temporarily unavailable
- JHelioviewer users may not be able to load data from GSFC
- Helioviewer API and other services may be temporarily interrupted

This maintenance is necessary to transfer some infrastructure components to improve service reliability and performance.

You may use the Helioviewer instance at [IAS](https://helioviewer.ias.u-psud.fr/) during the maintenance window.

We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience during this planned downtime.
