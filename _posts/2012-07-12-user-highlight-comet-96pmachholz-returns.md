[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) and Helioviewer.org user [otraLoly](http://www.youtube.com/user/otraLoly) shared this short video of the return of [Comet 96P/Machholz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/96P/Machholz) to the LASCO-C3 field of view. Thanks for sharing your video! More images of the comet will be available soon on Helioviewer.org.

The small, tadpole-like extended feature approximately in the center of the field of view in the image below is Comet 96P/Machholz.

Comet 96P/Machholz has an orbital period of about 5.2 years, which means it has been seen before in LASCO observations. Here is an example image from 2007

and five years before that in 2002,

The dates for the entry of Comet 96P/Machholz were obtained from [the transit page of the LASCO instrument](http://sungrazer.nrl.navy.mil/index.php?p=transits/transits). It is projected to be visible in the LASCO C3 field of view from July 12 &#8211; 17, and it may also be visible in the images from the STEREO A/B coronagraphs.
