We are _very_ pleased to announce that Helioviewer Project services are now back online.  


This means that [Helioviewer.org](http://www.helioviewer.org), [JHelioviewer](http://www.jhelioviewer.org), and [other](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/helioviewerorg-latest-image-of-the-sun/) applications that use Helioviewer Project services are now available and should be working as before. If you encounter any problems with any of our services please let us know. We are currently filling in missing data from 2011/08/05 through to 2011/09/16, and we ask for your patience during the next couple of weeks as we fill in the gaps. If you notice any gaps, please let us know, as we are eager to have as complete a record of solar activity as possible.

We do apologize for the interruption in service. This was caused by two distinct and unfortunately simultaneous hardware malfunctions on our server that took a long time to repair. We are looking exploring options that will ensure such a long break in service does not happen again. We are back now, and we hope you continue to explore your heliosphere!
