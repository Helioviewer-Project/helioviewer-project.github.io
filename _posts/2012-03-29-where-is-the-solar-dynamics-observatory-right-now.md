It&#8217;s [here](http://www.n2yo.com/?s=36395).

Why does the orbit have this shape? It&#8217;s because [SDO](http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/LWS/) takes so many large images that it has to have its own [ground station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_station) to receive all that data (around 1.5 TB/day). In order to keep the flow of data running off the spacecraft, its [geosynchronous orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit) was designed to maintain contact with the [ground station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Dynamics_Observatory#Communications).
