Many institutions host many different kinds of image data, either from observations or from simulations. Â I have put instructions on how to convert image data to a format the Helioviewer Project uses  [on our wiki page](http://www.helioviewer.org/wiki/index.php?title=Converting_FITS_to_JP2_for_the_Helioviewer_Project). The wiki is where we keep our must up-to-date instructions on the installation and use of all the software we are developing.

Contact me if you encounter any problem with the JP2Gen instructions , or with implementing JP2Gen on your local system (or any other part of the wiki). I&#8217;d be very happy to get your feedback!
