We are pleased to announce that the most recent, high quality STEREO images are now available on helioviewer.org. 

The [STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory)](http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov) mission is _very_ different from the other missions ([Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov) and [SOHO](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov)) we feature on helioviewer.org.

First off, there are _two_ spacecraft, called STEREO-A and STEREO-B. Both spacecraft orbit the Sun at roughly 1 AU ([astronomical unit](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/au.html)), or about as far away from Sun as the Earth is. However, STEREO-A is _moving ahead_ of the Earth in its orbit, and STEREO-B is _drifting behind_ the Earth in its orbit. This means that each STEREO spacecraft sees _different parts of the Sun, parts that we can&#8217;t see from Earth_. STEREO-B sees features on the Sun that we eventually see in SDO and SOHO, and STEREO-A allows us to see the continuing evolution of features that we did see in SDO and SOHO.

This plot shows where each spacecraft is now:

As you can see, they are quite far away from the Earth. This puts some operational constraints on each spacecraft that means we get high-quality images two days after they were taken. These are the data we are making available today; images from June 1st 2011, up to the most recently available data will be available initially. We ask for your patience, as we are uploading these images right now. Over the course of the next few weeks we will be making images from earlier in the mission available so that you can explore the Sun from many different angles over the past 4 1/2 years.

The benefit of seeing the Sun from many different angles is apparent when you look at the following three videos of the prominence eruption of June 7, 2011. The first one consists of images from SDO-AIA and SOHO-LASCO







We hope you enjoy these new images! As ever, please let us know if you spot any problems.
