Because of the increased interest in solar images caused by the appearance of [Comet Lovejoy](http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/pickoftheweek/old/03dec2011/), Helioviewer.org users may need to wait for longer than usual in order to create a movie.

JHelioviewer is a related effort to Helioviewer.org and provides support for accessing many of the same images as Helioviewer.org including LASCO and AIA, via a desktop application.  Try it out and let us know what you think.
