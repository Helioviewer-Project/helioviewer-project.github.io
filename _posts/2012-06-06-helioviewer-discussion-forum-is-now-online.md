Alongside of our coverage of the last [Transit of Venus](http://www.transitofvenus.org/) that most of us will get to see (the next one will be in [2117](http://www.transitofvenus.org/faq/113-when-is-the-next-transit-of-venus-after-2012) for those of you who are particularly ambitious!) we are also launching a new online discussion forum: [community.helioviewer.org](http://community.helioviewer.org/).
