Hello, world. That seems a like a simple enough start to the blog of the Helioviewer Project. We&#8217;ll post news about the Helioviewer Project; progress, outstanding issues, latest features, questions to you about features, and so on. We really want to hear your feedback on our project so the tools we develop are the ones you will use. So don&#8217;t hold back, and let us know what you think about the Helioviewer Project, and how we can improve it.
