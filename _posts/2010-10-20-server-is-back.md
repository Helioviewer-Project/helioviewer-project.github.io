Some people were aware that our server had a hardware issue shortly before the Fifth Solar Image Processing Workshop (http://sipworkv.sipwork.org/).  Bad timing.  But now the good news &#8211; we have it back, and we are filling it with JP2 images.  We should be heading back to full operations on our newly repaired server very soon.
