We now have a completely independent machine producing SOHO JP2 files. Files made on that machine are transferred to our main server (and a reference copy is kept). This makes it easier to maintain a stream of SoHO images independent of the machines on which JP2Gen is developed. Now all we have to do is take care of the new orientation of SoHO&#8230;!
