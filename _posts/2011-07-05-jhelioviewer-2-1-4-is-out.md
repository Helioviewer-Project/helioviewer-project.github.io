Due to the growing user community of JHelioviewer and helioviewer.org, our server traffic has increased significantly. This <a href="http://jhelioviewer.org/download.html" target="_blank">bug fix release</a>, together with the deployment of our <a href="http://wiki.helioviewer.org/wiki/JPIP_Server" target="_blank">new open-source JPIP server</a> addresses a number of bugs, some of which were related to high server load.
