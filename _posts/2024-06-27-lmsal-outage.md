2024-07-02 Update: SDO data observed during the outage is available on Helioviewer.

The data center managed by Lockheed Martin Solar & Astrophysics Lab (LMSAL)
will be offline between June 28, 5:00pm Pacific Time to late night June 29.

Helioviewer pulls SDO data from LMSAL so the latest SDO data will not
be available during this time. There will be a gap in
the data after the data center comes back online which will be filled in
next week.
